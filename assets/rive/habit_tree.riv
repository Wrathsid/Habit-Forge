# This is a placeholder for the Rive animation file
# In a real project, you would export a .riv file from Rive
# For now, this serves as a placeholder to maintain the project structure

# The habit_tree.riv file would contain:
# - Animated habit growth visualization
# - Interactive nodes representing habits
# - Smooth transitions between states
# - Particle effects for completions
# - Customizable colors and themes

# To create the actual Rive file:
# 1. Open Rive (rive.app)
# 2. Create a new animation
# 3. Design the habit tree with animated nodes
# 4. Export as .riv file
# 5. Replace this placeholder
